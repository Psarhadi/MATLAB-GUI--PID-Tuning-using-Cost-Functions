# MATLAB-GUI--PID-Tuning-using-Cost-Functions
# How to run:
Just open: PID_Cost.mlapp and run it.
There are sliders to easily tune Kp, Ki, and Kd and observe ISE, ITAE, CE and CR cost functions.

# Descriptions:
This GUI is provided for educational purposes, the provided PID controller can be tuned using different cost functions.
The example is adopted from JH Blakelock's book and the credit goes to:
Blakelock, John H. Automatic control of aircraft and missiles. John Wiley & Sons, 1991.

The controller is a custom-designed PID with rate feedback, there are sliders to tune the gains.
System output and the control signal will be plotted, and one can observe the effect of different tunings on the provided cost functions.

PS: This GUI is designed by MATLAB appdesigner in 2021a version, compatibility with other versions is not checked.
